Inline css refers to attributes within the html tags
-->

<html>

	<body style="background-color:lightBlue;">
		
		<h1 style="color:red;background-color:lightGrey;">Inline CSS </h1>
		
		<p style="color:black;border:2px solid orange;">
			Generally anything within the 'style' attribute is considered CSS, so border and font formating is generally not.
		</p>
		
		<p style="border:1px solid black; padding:10px; color:blue;font-family:courier; font-size:150%;">
			here you can see that lots of style can be applied, you just have to look it up <br /> (border,padding,color,font,size)
		</p>

		Color: <br />
		There are 140 specified colors, these can also be used in hex code. <br />
