<h1>CSIT128-Intro-to-web-tech</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

Contains all my notes, mostly written in html in order to become more familiar with the markup language, while undertaking CSIT128 at UOW.
As the notes were used for my personal learning, documents are informal and documentaion (as well as commenting) is missing within some files. The best documented notes include "javaScript.html" and "HTML notes.html"

If anyone manages to use these notes, leave a thanks!
